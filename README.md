# Shopping List

A simple shopping list web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with data storing using Local Storage

Users can:

- Add, update, and remove items from the shopping list.
- Clear all items with a single click.

Working on this project, I learned how to use Local Storage, also got more comfortable with manipulating the DOM, handling events, etc...

This project was part of Traversy Media's [Modern JavaScript Course](https://www.traversymedia.com/modern-javascript-2-0). Also, the CSS styling was included in the project's starter file.
